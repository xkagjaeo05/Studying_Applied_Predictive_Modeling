This repository is for studying the book, Applied Predictive Modeling By Max Kuhn and Kjell Johnson. Here I'm going to summarize the main concepts of each chapter and write almost all the codes for examples and exercises. I don't have much experience of analyzing data using R. Before two months ago, I've done data anaylsis and applied what I learnt from machine learning and deep learning using Python. I found R has huge advantage in statistics and analysizing data. By studying this book, I hope to review statistics and concepts of machine learning and get accustomed to programming language R.
